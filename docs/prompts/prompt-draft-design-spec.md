Draft the design specification for vX.X.Xx based on the roadmap and scope breakdown. Use the existing design specification template to structure your work. Include workflows, decision trees, deliverable criteria, use stories, use cases, unit testing, logging, inline documentation, code examples, etc. Do not make up functionality, but follow the designs, existing infrastructure, module/plugin structure, dependencies, and previous deferred features as they exist and are written.
