- **Style Configuration Record** — New `StyleConfiguration` record captures all style settings including readability constraints, voice analysis thresholds, and terminology overrides. Immutable design ensures thread safety.

- **License-Gated Project Config** — Project-level configuration is gated behind Writer Pro license (`Feature.GlobalDictionary`). Core users receive merged System + User configuration only.

- **Configuration Caching** — 5-second cache with manual invalidation via `InvalidateCache()`. Reduces file I/O overhead for frequently accessed configuration.

- **Security Safeguards** — 100KB file size limit prevents denial-of-service via oversized config files. Graceful YAML parse error handling with fallback to defaults.

- **Conflict Resolution** — New `IConflictResolver` detects and logs configuration conflicts between layers. Project-wins semantics ensure higher-priority sources always override. Term override logic handles exclusions vs additions with repository fallback. Rule ignore patterns support wildcards (`PASSIVE-*`, `*-WARNINGS`).

- **Override UI Infrastructure** — New `IProjectConfigurationWriter` enables users to ignore rules and exclude terms via project configuration. Atomic YAML writes prevent file corruption. `OverrideMenuViewModel` provides license-gated commands for context menu integration.

- **Ignored Files** — New `IIgnorePatternService` enables `.lexichordignore` files with glob pattern support (`*.log`, `build/**`, `**/temp/**`). Negation patterns (`!important.log`) un-ignore specific files. License-gated limits (Core: 5 patterns, Writer Pro: unlimited). Hot-reload via FileSystemWatcher with 100ms debounce.
