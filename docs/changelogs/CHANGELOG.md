# Lexichord Changelog

All notable changes to the Lexichord project are documented here.

This changelog is written for stakeholders and users, focusing on **what changed** rather than technical implementation details. For detailed technical changes, see the version-specific changelogs in this directory.

## [v0.0.2] - 2026-01-28 (In Progress)

### The Host Shell & UI Foundation

This release introduces the visual foundation of Lexichord — the Avalonia-based desktop application that will host all writing features.

#### What's New

- **Avalonia UI Framework Bootstrapped** — The application now launches as a proper desktop window instead of a console application. This establishes the foundation for all future UI work.

- **Podium Layout Shell** — The main window now features a structured layout with a top bar, navigation rail, content host, and status bar — the "Podium" where all future writing tools will perform.

#### Why This Matters

This work establishes:

1. **Visual Identity** — Lexichord now has a window, title, and theme infrastructure for building the interface.
2. **Cross-Platform Support** — Avalonia enables Windows, macOS, and Linux deployment from a single codebase.
3. **Modern UI Patterns** — The architecture supports compiled bindings, resource dictionaries, and theme switching.

## [v0.0.1] - 2026-01-28

### The Architecture Skeleton

This release establishes the foundation of the Lexichord application. While no visible features exist yet, this work creates the structural backbone that all future features will build upon.

#### What's New

- **Project Structure Established** — The codebase now follows a clean "Modular Monolith" architecture that separates core application code from future plugins and extensions.

- **Code Quality Safeguards Added** — Build-time checks ensure code consistency across the project, catching potential issues before they become problems.

- **Automated Testing Infrastructure** — A comprehensive test suite framework is in place, enabling developers to verify changes don't break existing functionality.

- **Continuous Integration Pipeline** — Every push and pull request now triggers automated builds and tests, ensuring code quality before it reaches the main branch.

#### Why This Matters

This foundational work ensures:

1. **Maintainability** — Clean separation of concerns prevents "spaghetti code" as the project grows.
2. **Extensibility** — The plugin architecture (coming in v0.0.4) will build directly on this work.
3. **Quality Assurance** — Automated tests catch regressions before they reach users.
4. **Developer Confidence** — Clear structure and testing make it easier for contributors to add new features safely.
5. **Continuous Integration** — Automated pipelines validate every change, preventing broken code from entering the main branch.
