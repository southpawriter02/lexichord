3. **Foundation** — Enables all data-dependent features (v0.0.6+).

---

## [v0.0.4] - 2026-01-28 (In Progress)

### The Module Protocol

This release establishes the module architecture that enables Lexichord's "modular monolith" — allowing features to be developed as independent modules while running in a single process.

#### What's New

- **Module Contract (`IModule`)** — A standardized interface defining how modules register services, initialize, and expose metadata.

- **Module Metadata (`ModuleInfo`)** — Immutable record containing module identity, version, author, and optional dependencies.

- **Module Loader (`IModuleLoader`)** — Discovers and loads modules from `./Modules/` at startup with two-phase loading (service registration before DI build, initialization after).

- **License Gate (Skeleton)** — Establishes license tier gating with `LicenseTier`, `ILicenseContext`, and `RequiresLicenseAttribute`. Stub implementation returns Core tier; v1.x will provide real validation.

- **Sandbox Module (Proof of Concept)** — First feature module validating the module architecture. Demonstrates discovery, service registration, and async initialization.

#### Why This Matters

This work enables:

1. **Extensibility** — Third-party and internal modules can be developed independently.
2. **Feature Isolation** — Each module encapsulates its own services and state.
3. **License Gating** — Future versions will enable per-module licensing tiers.

## [v0.0.3] - 2026-01-28 (In Progress)

### The Nervous System (Logging & DI)

This release establishes the runtime infrastructure that enables the application to "think" and report errors. This transforms the Avalonia shell into a properly instrumented, dependency-injectable application.

#### What's New

- **Dependency Injection Container** — Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection is now the sole IoC container. All services are resolved from the DI container instead of manual instantiation.

- **Structured Logging** — Serilog provides comprehensive logging with colorized console output for development and rolling file logs for production diagnostics.

#### Why This Matters

This work enables:

1. **Testability** — Services can now be mocked and isolated for unit testing.
2. **Module Foundation** — Module registration (v0.0.4) will build on this DI container.
3. **Flexibility** — Services can be swapped or decorated without modifying consuming code.

---

## [v0.0.2] - 2026-01-28 (In Progress)

### The Host Shell & UI Foundation

This release introduces the visual foundation of Lexichord — the Avalonia-based desktop application that will host all writing features.

#### What's New

- **Avalonia UI Framework Bootstrapped** — The application now launches as a proper desktop window instead of a console application. This establishes the foundation for all future UI work.

- **Podium Layout Shell** — The main window now features a structured layout with a top bar, navigation rail, content host, and status bar — the "Podium" where all future writing tools will perform.

- **Runtime Theme Switching** — Users can toggle between Dark and Light themes via the StatusBar button, with the application detecting and respecting OS preferences on first launch.

- **Window State Persistence** — Window position, size, maximized state, and theme preference are now remembered between sessions.

#### Why This Matters
