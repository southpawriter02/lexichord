      3. Focus on Business Outcomes
         - "What does this mean for the organization?"
      4. Highlight Decision Points
         - What actions are needed?
      5. Quantify Where Possible
         - Numbers, percentages, timelines

      4. Professional, confident tone
      5. No redundancy or filler

      - Are recommendations specific and actionable?
      - Is the ask clear?
